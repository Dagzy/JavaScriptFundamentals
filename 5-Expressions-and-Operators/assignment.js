//The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

//The equals sign is the assignment operator
//There are other operators that will modify the value and then reassign it
//Using += will add the value on the right-hand side and assign the new value
x += 6

//Using -= will deduct the value on the RHS
x -= 6

//Using *= multiplies the base value by the RHS
x *= 2

// Using /= divides the base value by the RHS
x /= 2
